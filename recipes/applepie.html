    <H3>It may be a basic apple pie, but you can never go wrong!</H3>

    <P>The staples are oftn staples for a reason. Sure, apples are widely available in our area and always have been. Thanks Johnny Appleseed!</P>
    <p>But that doesn't make this amazing apple pie any less delicious.</p>
    <H3>INGREDIENTS</H3>
    <ul>
        <li>Apples. (lots of them!) Choose a good variety of sweet and sour apples to create a balance. Don't be afraid to experiment!</li>
        <li>A premade pie crust. (Who has time for making pie crusts these days?</li>
        <li>Salted Butter. Get the good stuff. It matters.</li>
        <li>Cinammon. (To taste.)</li>
    </ul>

<H3>Steps:</H3>

    <ol>
        <li>Set out the crust and butter to get to room temperature. They will be far easier to work with. </li>
        <li>Peel, Slice, and Prep the apples.</li>
        <li>Place ingredients into pie crust.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350f until golden brown. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
